The reason I am making that game is one of my favorite flash game which I was playing in my childhood is no longer working properly for some reason. That's because that game is too old, or my operation system is OS X. Therefore, I am going to make the same kind of game to play it again and share my joyful experience with all people.

I have some goals I wanted to achieve through that game.
My three goals I hopo to achive through that game is...<br>
&emsp;1. Make My Own General Game Framework that Runs On Unity<br>
&emsp;2. Try Machine Learning AI<br>
&emsp;3. Publish To Apple Store, Google Play, ithc.io and/or Steam<br>

I'll keep it up.
