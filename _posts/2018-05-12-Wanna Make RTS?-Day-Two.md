I made unit and its agent. I made map swipeable and zoomable.
All things are going alright.

I am really looking forward to seeing comments on my YouTube above video.
But, I know I should not expect this much.
Just, I wanna interact with people who are interested in what I am interested in!
Those people are not in my college, so I really wish someone leave comments and give me interaction!
I really need it! lol

I'll keep working. See you next time.
