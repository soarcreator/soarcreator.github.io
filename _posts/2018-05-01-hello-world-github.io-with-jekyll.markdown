This is my first post here.
It took me a few days to establish this website hosted by GitHub Pages since I was not familiar with Jekyll, that is a static website generator I am using for this site.
People helped me there, [Jekyll-Talk][jekyll-talk].

If you are building this kind of page on GitHub Pages and Jekyll includes strange files despite files put in _include directory, note that we have to put Jekyll files in the root directory according to above.
Thank you, Frank!

I will post about me here tomorrow.
Thank you for readingðŸ˜„
